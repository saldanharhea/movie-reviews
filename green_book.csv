Author,Review
 It's what the Americans have called crowd-pleasing... which is not at all bad per se. [Full review in Spanish],Pablo A. Scholz
 Green Book lets itself be seen and able to be enjoyed without much guilt. [Full Review in Spanish],Diego Batlle
" Green Book chooses to recreate, with more sympathy than originality, the benevolence of friendship regardless of social differences. [Full Review in Spanish]",Mariana Fernández
" The tone of the film is sympathetic, but too complacent for the theme it's pretending to treat. [Full Review in Spanish]",Benjamín Harguindey
" Green Book is impregnated with funny moments, conveying assertive energy that occasionally resembles the classics.",Filipe Freitas
 Ali's performance certainly merits his Oscar nomination.,Alison Rowat
" Green Book has a race problem, but it delivers cringeworthy depictions of women and gay men too.",Li Lai
" Nuanced in places, tellingly clunky in others, its central idea is old-fashioned yet beguiling: that racism can be defeated if only people get to know each other. Still, Mortensen is excellent and Ali outstanding as an unexpected friendship takes root.",Sarah Cartland
" The film has a warm, congenially progressive vibe and a wonderfully street line of humour.",Jim Schembri
 This film coddles white viewers to make them feel good on the inside while black/people of colour viewers are left looking at a jaded film that wasn't made with a true black perspective in mind.,Jamal-Dean Grootboom
" Green Book is both a joyous and sorrowful film, capturing the humour of an unlikely friendship, and the sadness from watching the effects of deeply ingrained racism.",Shauna Fox
" At the end of the day Green Book has a message that perhaps seems obvious, but is necessary taking into account the time in which we live. [Full review in Spanish]",Abigail Camarillo
 The film becomes inoffensive and without substance because it never earns its ending and never shows us how they truly became friends. [Full Review in Spanish],Erick Estrada
" The film by Peter Farrelly edits reality and does not bother the viewer, reducing a complex problem, like racism, to a fable with a happy ending. [Full Review in Spanish]",Fernanda Solórzano
" Whenever the plot appears ready to crash headlong into cliché, Farrelly avoids the danger with a neat little swerve.",John McDonald
" A glib road movie/buddy picture hybrid that is so slick, stupid and obnoxious that it would not surprise me in the slightest if it did go on to become one of the front-runners in this year's Oscar derby.",Peter Sobczynski
" Green Book feels like a movie lost in time, and we have to do better. We demand better.",Roxana Hadadi
" a warm-hearted, old-fashioned cinematic appeal to our better sensibilities, something that is roundly lacking in the Trump Era of vitriol and division",James Kendrick
" [Mahershala Ali] is perfect casting to play this incarnation of Shirley, a savant-like prodigy whose intellect and musical abilities alienate him from virtually everybody.",Stephen Porzio
 Do not miss it. [Full review in Spanish],William Venegas
 [A] flawed but oddly joyful movie elevated far above its limitations by two sublime performances.,Matthew Norman 
 Mahershala Ali's performance shines through despite ill-judged moments from director Peter Farrelly.,Wendy Ide
 A portly Mortensen just about shaves Ali with a transformative performance but they make a nifty double act regardless.,Hilary A White
" The performances strengthen each other as the film progresses, Ali drily amused and withheld, Mortensen earthy and expansive.",Tom Shone
" A funny, touching, and un-cynical road movie with an infectiously jubilant lead duo, it's a total knockout.",Jack Blackwell
" Green Book is a film about racism told by white people. And it really, really shows.",Harris Dang
" Everything is simple and yet it works. Effectively, effective. [Full Review in Spanish]",Luis Martínez
 Green Book owes some of its likability to Capra and to mediocre imitators that play with a secure and almost always infallible formula. [Full Review in Spanish],Carlos Boyero
" Two fine performances, but Peter Farrelly's movie sugar-coats the hard questions.",Adam Sweeting
 What's not up for debate is that the magic of screen chemistry is once again showcased as Ali and Mortensen bring out the best in each other and their respective characters.,Harry Guerin
" A bizarre fish-out-of-water comedy masquerading as a serious awards-season contender by pretending to address the deep wound of racial inequality while demonstrating its profound inability, intellectually and dramatically, to do that.",Kevin Maher
" [A] sweet, engagingly unsubtle picture.",Brian Viner
" Not previously known for his comic timing, Mortensen hilariously inhabits the pugnacious but fair-minded Tony, who constantly dispenses unasked for opinions.",Paul Whitington
" Excellent, nuanced performances from both leads elevate the movie above its good natured but rather bog-standard, neatly packaged beats.",Rosie Fletcher
" Even with admirable acting, and such a crowd-pleasing, inspirational story, Green Book essentially feels like civil-rights lip-service for a white audience... it's a disappointing portrayal of historical systemic racism. ",Zoe Margolis
" True, Ali acts the hell out of his role, but his interpretation of the character is too constrained by the anti-intellectual lens through which we're being forced to view him.",Alistair Harkness
 Such a cosy and ultimately heartwarming story won't satisfy everyone - but Mortensen and Ali are so good together it's absolutely worth soaking up the hope it proffers.,Jamie East
" [Green Book]... flees from the typical trappings of the biopic genre to which it belongs, offering a quite universal story. [Full review in Spanish]",José Martín
" So much fun in the moment, you almost feel bad later on for realising it doesn't add up.",Robbie Collin
" This is a movie about insulting stereotypes and the dirigiste devices of organised racism that delivers its own, audience-insulting stereotypes, with a tonne of dramatic directionalism.",Nigel Andrews
" Where Green Book runs into trouble is if you scratch even a millimetre beneath its fuzzy, warm surface.",Wenlei Ma
 Ali and Mortensen make a tremendously engaging odd couple. Both give such nuanced and well-observed performances that most audiences will swallow the sentimental moralising as easily as Tony digests his hot dogs.,Geoffrey Macnab
" It's hard not to like this film, but it's also proof that audiences do like to hear fairytales. [Full Review in Spanish]",Alberto Corona
" There are a few cheesy moments as the two men learn life lessons from each other but the acting is a joy, the co-stars coaxing complexities from their characters. ",Larushka Ivan-Zadeh
" Ali presents Shirley as a fierce pioneer, whose bravery and humanity is easy to admire.",Rob Carnevale
 ...much of this is cringe-inducing from the vantage point of 2018.,Josh Larsen
" Well, it's a handsomely made and watchable picture and there is a real warmth in Ali and Mortensen's performances.",Peter Bradshaw
 Just enough (laughing) gas in the tank to merit its two-hour runtime.,Adam Woodward
" Mortensen and Ali make an irresistible duo in a well-meaning and touching, albeit slightly misjudged film...",Emma Simmonds
" The occupation with racism in 1960s America is translated in the movie into simplistic, sentimental kitsch, which creates for present-day America a reactionary white fantasy.",Uri Klein
 The gears engage. The motor runs smoothly. The destination is achieved. There are worse things in heaven and earth.,Donald Clarke
 Peter Farrelly's Green Book offers an exploration of racism fatally undermined by white saviour syndrome.,Roe McDermott
" That is the true journey of Green Book, the one made by two antagonistic men until they realize that they are the same. [Full review in Spanish]",Andrea G. Bermejo
" It is certainly a heartfelt, possibly an accurate portrayal of a wonderful, life-affirming friendship. It absolutely suggests that we are all capable of change. But, as social commentary, it's far too gentle...",Nikki Baughan
" There is a surprising amount of charm that manages to sell the preposterous schmaltz, making it feel entertaining, if slight.",Alistair Ryder
" Awards-bait or not, Green Book plays as a deftly disarming film about friendship and unity in divisive times: calculated, perhaps, but calculated from a kind, sincere place.",Kevin Harley
" A supremely likeable film. Its message might seem obvious and its template overcooked, but it boasts a warm heart, with two astoundingly good lead performances to guide it home.",John Nugent
" While there isn't some glorious solution offered here as a way to end racism and intolerance forever, there is a sense of hope and a sweetness of spirit...",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley
" Farrelly is seeking to entertain with Green Book, not to provoke. The performances of his actors - Mortensen, rarely better, and Ali - make it all worthwhile. ",David Stratton
" With great performances and a soundtrack that revs your soul, it's a film well worth your time and money.",Pamela Powell
" 'Green Book' has all the hallmarks of a new American classic. But dig a little deeper and you'll soon discover this ""feel-good"" film is problematic as all hell, making its adoration by awards season rather infuriating.",Doug Jamieson
" Like its (white) protagonist, Green Book is limited by its own blinkered perspective. Some will no doubt find its revelations minor at best, or pointless at worst; but as a character study... it's surprisingly frank.",Angelo Muredda
" Green Book is a genuinely irresistible feel good film of the highest calibre, capturing a rare spark between two great actors while maintaining a fire in its belly when it comes to matters of acceptance, tolerance and understanding.",Leigh Paatsch
" The performances are superb, on the back of a tight script.",Paul Byrnes
 The odd-couple comic setups feel easy and unforced. There is genuine chemistry between the brash Vallelonga and the stuffy Shirley. ,John Lui
 The lead actors build an enjoyable back-and-forth chemistry that elevates the film's quality even as it strikes highly predictable and archetypal beats. ,Damien Straker
" The final destination may feel a tad too precious, but embarking on this inspirational journey is still well worth it.",Jeanmarie Tan
 Green Book is a very condescending and familiar portrait of racism in the United States and the greatest virtue of this movie is the serene performance of Mahershala Ali.,Jorge (JJ) Negrete
" Mortensen, rarely seen in comic roles, plays the buffoon like a virtuoso. And Ali...finds dignity in the most unlikely of places. ",Vicky Roach
" Green Book may misguidedly center on the chauffeur played by Mortensen-almost fatally so-but as a Mahershala Ali (and Don Shirley) delivery system, it gets the job done.",Simon Miraudo
 Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen play off each other with such attention and subtlety that they entirely avoid the cliches or sentimentality that might be the normal byproduct of many of their scenes as written.,Leslie Combemale
" Both Mortensen and rapper/actor Mahershala give us profoundly anchored characterisations, showing two imperfect people grappling with a flawed world. ",Andrew L. Urban
" Honesty, dignity and courage are the themes of one of the best films of the year - an odd couple road movie in which Viggo Mortensen delivers a performance that is note-perfect.",Louise Keller
 Basically In The Heat of the Night repurposed as a Christmas stocking stuffer...,Aaron Yap
" It's a good film. Maybe it can elicit constructive dialogues about our past, present and shared future.",Amanda Greever
 When genius is not enough,S. James Wegg
" Farrelly zeroes in on a portrayal of humanity with all its bumps and bruises. That social change often comes through a combination of love, exposure and confrontation.",Carey-Ann Pawsey
" Regardless, the actors... make them feel true. Which is precisely what a film needs to elevate it from mere melodrama to something closer to actual art. ",Dan Webster
 Director Peter Farrelly's empathy for the story and ability to draw such striking and nuanced performances from the actors will inspire audiences. ,Sr. Rose Pacatte
" I laughed a lot and responded to the emotional content of this film, which is powerful. There is an old saying that drama is easy and comedy is hard. This film gets both just right, and that is truly rare, making this a movie to treasure.",Robert Roten
" ...the film merely skims the surface of systemic American racism, choosing to forgo depth for formulaic feel-good tropes.",Joel Mayward
 It was just portraying this one friendship and it did a great job. I love both lead performances and the script is excellent.,Rachel Wagner
" The exceptionally crisp performances by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are but two of the great things about Green Book, a very solid contender for Best Picture accolades, and much more.",Elias Savada
 GREEN BOOK is a truly delightful dramedy that should be on everyone's list of films to see before the Oscars.,Jeanne Kaplan
" Two extraordinary performances by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, along with an exceptional script, make GREEN BOOK easily one of the best films of the year. ",David Kaplan
 The greatest weakness of Green Book is that it insists on trying to find the humour in nearly every situation Shirly and Vallelonga encounter.,Graeme Tuckett
" With powerful lead performances, prevalent messages and a real sense of fun, hopefully the rest of 2019 can be as good as Green Book.",Matt Hudson
" One of those message movies, the kind that apparently take it for granted that everything that's ever been bad has been fixed.",Tim Brayton
" Filled with intimate moments from a son's memories of his father's tales, this feel good drama takes us on a road trip as opposites find common ground. Prepare for the best kind of tension as we hope/fear for the characters.",Julia Swift
" Mahershala Ali survives with a shred of dignity intact, but Viggo Mortensen may never recover.",Daniel Barnes
" But it is the performances by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, their on-screen chemistry, their characters' moments of quiet reflection and startling revelation, that make this a must-see. ",Diane Pershing
 Ali and Mortensen are both spectacular.,J. Olson
" It is all formula, but it is likable formula. ",Mark R. Leeper
" Within its predictable context, Green Book is an accomplished and engaging picture.",Matt Brunson
 Green Book lulls audiences into feeling as if they are opening their minds to topic of inequality without having to confront the issue in any meaningful way.,Courtney Small
" Despite its problematic rose-colored outlook, Green Book still is one of the year's best films thanks to two stellar acting efforts (from Mortensen and Ali).",Matt Ward
" First-rate execution can't solve all of a film's problems, but Mortensen and Ali offer a reminder that it can solve an awful lot of them.",Christopher Orr
" Hums along about smoothly as what boils down to 'My Cousin Vinny Teaches Carlton Banks To Get His Blackness Back' probably can.""",Bob Chipman
" It's part road trip, part buddy film, and entirely heartwarming.",Linda Cook
" Above all, the film is a surprising glimpse of the previously hidden talents of director Peter Farrelly, and hopefully a sign of more to come.",Monica Reid
" Great turns by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali lift this neat, feel-good (true story) drama. [Full review in Spanish] ",Fico Cangiano
" Farrely and his production team are aware that there is no simple answer to the central issues in the film, but that does not stop them from closing the film with what is definitely the equivalent of a happy Hollywood ending. [Full Review in Spanish]",Juanma Fernández París
" Take a true story, add a super-smart script, brilliant turns by the two stars, and matching support from Linda Cardellini as Mortensen's wife, and you get a bullseye crowd-pleaser.",Jim Lane
 Mahershala Ali was fantastic and Viggo Mortensen was great. You really see the range of their acting ability and the work well together. ,Jeremy Jahns
" If you go to the movies and you want a pat on the head, this is going to be your movie.",Matthew Passantino
 What Farrelly has succeeded in assembling out of used parts is a gleaming crowd-pleaser that fires on all feel-good pistons.,Rick Kisonak
 Sidelining Shirley even further when he was already so isolated in real life means that the film is not really doing him the honor it thinks it is.,Tomas Trussow
" Green Book (fancies) itself a progressive .... awards season film, but there are moments in the narrative which are unbelievably tone deaf and in truth, almost regressive. ",Kimberly Pierce
 A touching biopic with a timely universal message about brotherhood and tolerance.,Kam Williams
" Though breezily entertaining, this cinematic vehicle also lurches into and out of the usual racial potholes, making its song of the South--and North--catch in the throat.",Peter Canavese
" Green Book, is the Oscar-baitiest of Oscar-bait films.",Di Golding
 Farrelly strikes the perfect balance between platonic rom-com and social commentary and delivers a film that elevates itself above the genre's tired conventions.,Victor Stiff
" ...applies a light touch and precision...dealing with racial prejudice, has sizeable relevance in today's market.",Cain Noble-Davies
" Much like its main characters, the film evolves as it goes and turns into something both highly entertaining and heartfelt. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Violence, etc. - also Available)",Jim Judy
" Call this actors' duet sentimental and simplistic at your own peril. Green Book may well move you, possibly to tears, at the thought of real social change and kindness (at a time when we need it badly).",Joshua Rothkopf
 Sometimes it's OK to cooperate with a movie. Just sit back and enjoy the journey guilt free.,Edward Johnson-Ott
 The story enlightens with humor as well as pathos if somewhat one-sided.,Wendy Shreve
" Taking advantage of an established and successful cinematic model, Farrelly builds a nice comedy that works wonders. [Full review in Spanish]",Ruben Peralta Rigaud
" The interaction between the two veterans is instant magic -- a chemistry that feels like these actors have been friends for many, many years. It's that chemistry that really fuels Green Book.",Micheal Compton
" It's excerpt-ready for the Oscars, with the little blocks of conflict quickly precipitated and solved in a fast minute. The self-congratulation is thick.",Richard von Busack
" More slight than sobering, this is a charming, deftly performed piece of work.",Cameron Frew
" Thanks to a blazing performance from Mahershala Ali, you might even believe that Green Book is good.",Alan French
" A pleasant, humorous movie, affable but extremely shallow. A well-intentioned but rather clueless feel-good effort.",Eric D. Snider
 [A] throwback ... driven by the immense talent of its lead performers ... thoughtful and funny and heartbreaking; a hell of a compelling and emotionally engaging story.,Allen Adams
" As Dr. Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali embodies the inflexible gravity of his self-image.",Diane Carson
" The movie glides by on cruise control, thanks to its charismatic stars... Together, they make this a trip worth taking.",Lisa Jensen
" Green Book might not ever go too far into the darkest implications of racism. It does, however, offer a hopeful message by showing how the right circumstances can cause individuals to challenge their own prejudices.",Mike McGranaghan
" It, like the many movies before it about the black-white relations of generations past, will not likely solve the problems of modern racism, but it's still an important reminder that we can always learn new things about and from one another.",Todd Gilchrist
" Peter Farrelly has made a film that feels like a perfectly sanded piece of wood...This isn't a bad movie. It's a nice movie, but I'm struggling with whether or not it's a good movie.",Tim Brennan
" Peter Farrelly's film is far more endearing, precise, and tricky than its conventional racial scenario leads one to expect.",Josh Cabrita
" Initially, the film seems doomed to be an annoying Driving Miss Daisy spin on The Odd Couple. But the stars are far too good for that...",Eleanor Ringel Cater
 Viggo Mortensen was fantastic...I felt like I was looking at a different guy. ,Tony Baker
" It seems this old-timey salve remains effective with audiences and among the critical set, despite talk of an assumed progressive cultural shift.",tt stern-enzi
" Farrelly's pacing is impressive, turning in a whopping 130-minute movie that simply flies by, and never feels too heavy or too long, and never outstays its welcome. ",Jeffrey M. Anderson
 Green Book is the one film you'll be cheering for at this year's Oscars. Mortensen and Ali are a terrific team.,Joe Friar
" ""Green Book"" isn't all that interesting but for its inadvertent role as a potential conversation starter about Mortensen's N-word-related chastisement - assuming anyone is willing to talking about it openly. ",Cole Smithey
" This movie, if you go for the right reasons, it's certainly a winner.",Mark Ellis
" It works, all the way around, and I absolutely loved it.",Kristian Harloff
 The performances and the chemistry between Mortensen and Ali is electrifying.,Lapacazo Sandoval
" The script has some funny moments and the relationship between Ali and Mortensen has a natural chemistry that draws in the viewer... Unfortunately, Green Book doesn't use it's full potential, as it softens its message.",Kt Schaefer
 It's another movie about racism and the civil rights era that's told almost entirely through the eyes of a white guy. This isn't a film about racism; it's the true story of a white man noticing racism. ​ (Broad Street Review) ,Stephen Silver
" It's the film's right to do so, but the real world lurks just off camera.",Tony Macklin
 ...a compulsively watchable drama that's been adorned with a whole host of appealing elements...,David Nusair
" However much I rolled my eyes at its cornball touches, I have to admit that the film generates a great deal of goodwill, due to its smart pace, bright colors, and the Mortensen/Ali double act.",Robert Horton
 While the [Green Book] gives us incredible performances ... I still found myself watching a film with some of the same stereotypical tropes.,Kay-B Giddens
" In their predictable way, Tony Lip and Dr. Shirley give us hope for the future.",Kelly Vance
" Green Book is a crowd-pleaser through-and-through...but some might find its depictions a bit too watered-down, its story a bit too tidy.",Tom Santilli
" Mortensen and Ali are a joy to watch, but Green Book is just a warm bath of clichés.",Caryn James
 A road movie turned buddy movie about the friendship between two very different men. ,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat
" Green Book operates in a Fisher Price world, where every heart can be changed and friendship always prevails.",Jourdain Searles
" Green Book is a delightful and inspiring story fueled by terrific performances by its leads, a sharp screenplay, and deft direction.",Chris Agar
" It's not cinematic calculus, but the formula works for a reason. Moviegoers want to be hopeful that things like racism can eventually be overcome.",Jeffrey Lyles
" Green Book is little more than a film about two people who become friends, but, especially in this day and age, that's more than enough.",Shawn Hazelett
" [Farrelly's] actors, though, do a great job... and forge a genuine chemistry, despite such overwrought handling.",Tom Meek
" Similar to Hidden Figures, prying deeper truths out of historical injustice with warm humour and engaging, gently nudging drama.",Rich Cline
" The movie's really nice, and it's hard to get too mad at it. Ali and Mortensen are both awfully good, and the script, for all its familiarity, is kind of comforting in its shticky predictability.",Ned Lannamann
 The film is effortlessly soul-stirring.,Renuka Vyavahare
" The comic timing and openheartedness that Farrelly imbues the film with goes a long way towards getting you on its side, and if nothing else, at least Mortensen and Ali get to revel in showy roles.",Emily Wheeler
 Ali's performance truly becomes a great one in a movie whose own strength is the way it simply allows humanity to shine through the flaws.,John Urbancich
 A heartfelt drama that's inspiring and uplifting - with Oscar-caliber performances.,Susan Granger
" The comedy woven through the entire script is surprising, but completely natural. The friendship that develops between these two dissimilar men is heartwarming and the fact that it's based on a true story ... makes it even more so. ",Sarah Gopaul
" Peter Farrelly, the guy who helmed ""MOVIE 43"", made one of the best films of the year and that's a massive statement I'm happy to make.",Rendy Jones
 The lengths [it goes] to make the internal turmoil tearing Shirley apart a lesson for Tony rather than an indictment on our nation's abhorrent history is unfathomable.,Jared Mobarak
" Director Peter Farrelly didn't produce a flawless film, but he hit an appropriately inspirational and life-affirming theme and tone with ease.",Kiko Martinez
" ""Green Book"" is a feel-good movie, with strong performances and a generous spirit. But maybe this isn't the time to feel good.",Rob Thomas
 Green Book is effective and affecting while being careful to avoid overdosing its audience on material that some might deem too shocking or upsetting.,James Berardinelli
 The movie is slightly over two hours and it was one of those two plus hours movies that I didn't really want to end because I liked spending time with both of these guys.,Martin Thomas
 This movie works against the odds. I didn't want to say I liked this movie. This is the Forrest Gump of race films.,Korey Coleman
" Green Book won't pass the sniff test for those demanding period realism or a hard-hitting, nuanced take on racism. It's earnest and uplifting, and it's racial commentary isn't subtle.",Stephen Rebello
" Aside from the all-pervasiveness of the prejudice, the film tracks the casual cruelty it entailed, and yet manages to not be grim. Part of this is a result of some artful writing.",Madhusree Ghosh
 A well-meaning but glib and shallow ode to interracial healing.,Mark Jenkins
 While I can recommend the drama it isn't without some rather substantial reservations...,Sara Michelle Fetters
 Better to view Green Book as an anecdotal tale which - no matter how amusing - doesn't speak to complex racial issues that remain frustratingly unresolved in 2018.,Robert Denerstein
" The actors give it their all, but they come across as extreme caricatures.",Max Weiss
" ""Green Book"" disappoints as purely a feel-good Racism 101 type of comedy-drama, almost feeling like a ""this is how things used to be"" presentation when ""things haven't changed as much as you think"" is closer to the truth.",Michael Smith
 Green Book is very aware of the ideological divide it hopes to bridge.,Glenn Heath Jr.
" The perfect comfort film to take your racist uncle too, cause heck, even if they are a closed-minded ass, being a racist can still be...funny?",Rosalie Kicks
" Its pleas for empathy and elevated social awareness are admirable, even if the jagged edges and racial tensions have been smoothed over.",J.R. Kinnard
" This is an expertly-acted, perfectly telegraphed message movie that knows the buttons it's pushing, and pushes them all, right on cue. This is not a knock against it, it's a compliment.",Adam Graham
" It's exhilarating watching a movie and realizing, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the performances on display are locks for Oscar consideration.",Sean O'Connell
 Green Book is about two men from very different worlds and experiences who discover their common humanity.,Daniel M. Kimmel
" Exposing the template for friendship that continues to push our nation positively forward even as there are steps backward, ""Green Book"" is one of the year's best films and is not to be missed.",Jonathan W. Hickman
" If a positive guarantee seems a bit of a cheat for a dramatic film tackling a tough subject, it's a welcome bit of fluff in today's political climate: humanity has done and can continue to do better.",Kevin A. Ranson
" The film, co-written by Vallelonga's son Nick, owes what artistic success it offers to two strong central performances.",Hope Madden
 A heartfelt ode to the bond between two real-life men.,Rafer Guzman
" Mortensen is simply wonderful, bringing accessibility and humor to a role that, in another actor's hands, might have been relegated to a meathead racist stereotype.",Cameron Meier
" Mortensen and Ali have such great chemistry and give such great performances, that it's easy to watch them banter and teach the world to be more tolerant.",Fred Topel
" 'Green Book' rests on the shoulders of Ali and Mortensen. Their trajectory is quite familiar - two people with nothing in common, who, thrown together, form a bond and come to appreciate their differences.",Bob Bloom
 [T]here are elements here that elevate the film beyond its naïve outlook on race and racism.,Mark Dujsik
" Green Book means so well, and admittedly, it just gets by on its leads and its good humor. ",Blake Goble
" Green Book is as much a serious statement on race relations as Shrek is a treatise on environmental preservation ... but what points it makes, it makes well enough.",Sean Collier
" Much praise for Farrelly, who finds the right tone in ""Green Book,"" not easy for a subject that requires a light and deft touch to have any chance of success.",George Thomas
 Green Book sheds further light on America's troubled history. It is a story of friendship and understanding in a time of racial oppression.,Julian Roman
" You watch ""Green Book"" wishing it were a little better but nonetheless enjoying how very good much of it is, thanks to Mortensen and Ali, who make every moment sing.",Moira MacDonald
 The miles melt away with two of the most unforgettable characters from one of the best feel-good films of 2018.,Neil Pond
" Few films move me to real tears; this one did, and not just once.",Christopher Lloyd
" Borrowing the name of such a fraught piece of history and making a feel-good comedy about it, then failing to do that piece of history justice, is at best a misstep.",Alissa Wilkinson
" The acting is better than the dialogue, which is better than the plotting. And I have to confess that in the current, insanely divisive political climate, I enjoyed Green Book's spoon-feeding mightily.",David Edelstein
" Unwilling to reckon with America's past or present in any meaningful way, ""Green Book"" is largely a ""my black friend"" movie. And for all the masterful pauses, emphases and gestures at their command, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali can't save it.",Nick Rogers
" M oviegoers who will leave this movie having learned for the first time that Dr. Shirley and Green Books existed but only through a white lens, deserved better than this shallow introduction to an integral part of Black history. ",Brooke Obie
" An old-fashioned racial mash-up of Driving Miss Daisy and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Green Book is an exceedingly pleasant two-hander that soars off the pinball chemistry of stars Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.",Matt Oakes
" A seamless blend of humor and thoughtfulness, Farrelly's film effortlessly sweeps you along for its journey, becoming a pure pleasant-surprise crowd pleaser in the process.",Mike Scott
" Humor... keeps the movie floating, weightlessly, above the appalling bedrock of its ponderous assumptions.",Richard Brody
" ...the actors go all in on their roles, injecting subtlety into their respective larger-than-life personalities, Ali especially.",Matthew Dougherty
" It's not quite Racism for Dummies, but the strokes are so broad and the tone so breezy that ""I saw Green Book"" could qualify as the new ""I have a black friend.""",Barry Hertz
" The tone leans sentimental, if not quite sugary. But the actors' honest chemistry takes Farrelly's movie to the next level. This small tale of American goodness deserves your full attention.",Johnny Oleksinski
" In a world that seems to get uglier every day, this movie's gentle heart and mere humanity feel like a salve.",Leah Greenblatt
" The humor, as well as the drama, is often obvious, going for the easy marks. But ""Green Book"" is so relentlessly enjoyable and the two leads so pleasurable, you can't imagine skipping the ride. ",Al Alexander
 A must see movie in every way. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali take a road trip to the 1962 deep south that could very well end at the Oscars.,Pete Hammond
" With its entertaining personalities [and] witty banter ... Green Book [is] a feel-good movie that indeed leaves one feeling good, if conflictedly so.",Annlee Ellingson
" Witty and warm as cashmere, Green Book is a two-hander in which both stars soar with humor and heart.",Rex Reed
" Tony and ""Doc"" don't just learn from each other; this is heroic two-hander in which they both save each other too.",Mara Reinstein
" Thanks in large part to the winning chemistry between Ali and Mortensen, and a pretty darn inspirational true-life story as its foundation, this was one of the best times I've had at the movies this year.",Richard Roeper
" ""Green Book"" is created with crayons, making sure to keep edge out of the equation.",Brian Orndorf
" There is no shortage of trouble, violence and humiliation awaiting them and twists and a growing sense of love and acceptance, on both sides. This is a buddy story to end 'em all.",Anne Brodie
 Green Book is so heavy with seriousness that any humor about the essential qualities the men share -- or that complement their unlikely friendship -- is lost. This misjudgment fails to reverse the lachrymose gimmick of Driving Miss Daisy. ,Armond White
" An exposé of systemic racism and oppression this film is not. Yet, the film provides some levity and a human interest narrative that viewers may appreciate. ",Chauncey K. Robinson
" A smart, nuanced story of two men thrown together by unlikely circumstance, and how each gains something from the experience.",Chris Knight
" Intentionally or not, it flatters the delusion that racism, in its ugliest form, is more of a past-tense problem.",A.A. Dowd
 This true story mixing comedy and drama is just the film we need for this time of newly stirred racial divisiveness. Mortensen and Ali lift the material to great heights.,James Verniere
" Green Book is the kind of movie that leaves you with a feeling of elation. That doesn't happen enough, and when it does, it is often accompanied by a heavy dose of sentiment. Not this time. This is pure entertainment",Leonard Maltin
" A fine setup for two strong-willed characters to have at each other... Yet Green Book wears thin, and how could it not, since it's basically an illustrative construction in which each scene has a predictable shape and a clear-cut purpose.",Joe Morgenstern
" This film cuts right through your defenses. That's because the performances by the two actors, especially Mortensen, are so hugely entertaining. ",Peter Rainer
" It's easy to wish ""Green Book"" itself wasn't quite so ham-fisted at times, or on-the-nose with its dialogue. But... the movie possesses hard-to-resist warmth in its underlying theme, and welcome humor in the mismatched buddy dynamic.",Brian Lowry
" If the film works at all, it's because of Ali's layered, unforced acting.",Kent Turner
" Crowd-pleasing drama explores race, class, friendship.",Sandie Angulo Chen
